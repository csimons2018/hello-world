hello-world
===========
      This is my hello world of github. I am going through the tutorial and it 
  asked me to edit this file so that I could make a commit. It also asked me 
  to write a little bit about myself. So, my name is Cody Simons and I am 18 
  years old. I am going into my freshman years of college at the UCR Bournes
  College of Engineering. I am currently majoring in Electrical Engineering and
  I started this github account becuase I have been coding for softcore for two
  years and decided to finally get in on some of this github action.
